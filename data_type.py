# In python there are 2 data types :
    # 1. Mutable Data Type : Mutable DAta Type are those datatype that can be change any value .
    # 2. Immutable Data Type : Are those datatpye that can not be change any value  .

    # IMMutable data type :
        # 1.  integers
        # 2.  Float
        # 3.   Complex Number
        # 4. String 
        # 5. Tuple
        # 6. List

    #  Mutable Data type:
        # 1. Dictionary
        # 2. Set
        # 3. Byte Array


# a= 10
# v = 20.1
# d = 2j+3
# print(a,type(a))
# print(v,type(v))
# print(d,type(d))


# STRING: -->>> A String is a collection of one or more characters put in a single quote, double_quote or Triple quote .
#  Multi_line Strings can be denoted using triple quotes, ''' or """

# s = "This  is a boy"
# print(s ,type(s))

# D =  """hello789542"""
# print(D,type(D))

# e = '10'
# print(e,type(e))


# LIST:---->>>>>  List is an ordered sequence of items.
#  It is one of the most used datatype in python and is very flexible.
# []

# l = [10,5.5,'kaushik']
# l[2]=30
# print(l,type(l))

# TUPLE: ------>>>>>>>>>>> Tupel is an ordered of items same as a list.
#  if is defined within paraentheses() where items are separated by commas.

# t = (5,'hello',1+3j)

# print(t,type(t))

# DICTIONARY:----------->>>>>> Dictionary is an unordered collection of key-value pairs.

# In python , dictionary are defined within braces{} with each item being a pair in the form key:value

# d = {
#     'course_name':'Python',
#     'Course-duration':'2 Months'

# }
# print(d['Course-duration'])
# print(d,type(d))



# SET :------>>>>> A set is an unordered collection of items .
#  Every set elements is unique (no duplicates) and must be immutable (Cannot be changed)
# {}


# my_set = {1,2,3,4,5}
# print(my_set,type(my_set))


# s= {1,2,1,5,3,4,2,5}
# print(s)
